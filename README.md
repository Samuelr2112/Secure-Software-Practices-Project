# Secure-Software-Practices-Project

# Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing best practices for secure software development by utilizing encryption algorithms, SSL certificate generation, and secure communication protocols. The core of the project is a Spring Boot application that functions as an SSL server with a RESTful API endpoint for calculating checksums using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. The project demonstrates the implementation of secure communications and addresses industry standards for secure software, such as input validation, error handling, and encryption.

# Features
Key components of the project include the selection and deployment of an appropriate encryption algorithm, with a focus on the comparison of symmetric and non-symmetric keys, as well as different hash functions and bit levels. The project also includes the generation of SSL certificates to enable secure communication over HTTPS. Additionally, the project emphasizes testing and refactoring code to ensure compliance with secure software standards. This process includes verifying that input data is validated and securely processed, error logging is implemented correctly, and all dependencies are managed to avoid vulnerabilities.

# Files
The project consists of multiple sections that cover the encryption process, SSL certificate generation, and testing. Screenshots are provided to demonstrate the successful creation and deployment of certificates, secure browser communications, and the execution of refactored code. The final report outlines the use of industry-standard best practices, including proper encryption, secure communication protocols, and the mitigation of security risks through thorough testing and validation.
